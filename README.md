# A brief introduction to Bayesian nonparametrics through the Dirichlet process mixture model

Github repository of Bayesian Analysis' final project. Here you will find the code for a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model using the Chinese restaurant process for multivariate density estimation and clustering built using NIMBLE in R. It includes an example with simulated data coming from 4 different bivariate Gaussian distributions.

Moreover, in the file "extra_semiparametric_regression.Rmd", I included an example for a semiparametric hierarchical bayesian regression. It includes a DPM built with the truncated strÂ¡ick-breaking representation to model random slopes nonparametrically.
