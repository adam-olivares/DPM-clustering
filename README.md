# A brief introduction to Bayesian nonparametrics through the Dirichlet process mixture model

Github repository of Bayesian Analysis' final project. Here you will find the code for a Dirichlet process mixture model for multivariate density estimation and clustering built using NIMBLE. It includes an example with simulated data.

Moreover, in the file "extra_semiparametric_regression.Rmd", I included an example for a semiparametric hierarchical bayesian regression. It includes a DPM to model random slopes nonparametrically.
